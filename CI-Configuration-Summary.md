# CI Configuration Summary

## Changes Made

### ❌ Removed from CI Pipeline

**GUI Test Job** - Completely removed the entire `gui-test` job which included:
- GUI unit tests (`JpegScalerGUITest`)
- Virtual display setup (Xvfb)
- GUI JAR startup testing
- Screenshot generation and capture
- GUI-related artifact uploads

**Related Files Deleted**:
- `test-gui-screenshot.sh` - GUI screenshot test script
- `GUI-Screenshot-Setup.md` - Screenshot setup documentation
- `CI-Screenshot-Troubleshooting.md` - Troubleshooting guide
- `CI-Screenshot-Fix-Summary.md` - Fix summary documentation

### ✅ Kept in CI Pipeline

**1. Core Test Job** (runs on Java 11, 17, 21):
- **Unit Tests**: `mvn clean test` - Tests all core functionality
- **CLI Integration Tests**: Comprehensive testing of command-line interface
- **Image Processing Tests**: Tests with real JPEG images
- **Output Verification**: Validates scaled images have correct dimensions
- **JAR Building**: Creates executable JAR file
- **Artifact Upload**: Uploads test images and output files

**2. Integration Test Job** (runs on Java 11):
- **Error Condition Testing**: Tests invalid inputs, missing files, etc.
- **Performance Testing**: Tests with large images
- **Edge Case Testing**: Validates error handling and boundary conditions

## Current CI Pipeline Structure

```yaml
name: CI

jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        java: [11, 17, 21]
    steps:
      - Download test image
      - Run unit tests (mvn clean test)
      - Build executable JAR
      - Test CLI with multiple scenarios
      - Verify output image dimensions
      - Upload test artifacts
  
  integration-test:
    needs: test
    steps:
      - Test error conditions
      - Performance test with large images
```

## Test Coverage Maintained

The CI pipeline still provides comprehensive testing coverage:

### ✅ **Unit Tests**
- All core classes (`JpegScaler`, `JpegScalerCLI`)
- Image processing algorithms
- Command-line argument parsing
- Error handling and validation

### ✅ **CLI Integration Tests**
- Basic image scaling (exact dimensions)
- Aspect ratio preservation
- Quality settings
- Width-only scaling
- Height-only scaling
- Help and version commands

### ✅ **Verification Tests**
- Output file creation
- Correct image dimensions
- File size validation
- ImageMagick integration

### ✅ **Error Handling Tests**
- Missing input files
- Invalid parameters
- Unsupported file formats
- Edge cases and boundary conditions

### ✅ **Performance Tests**
- Large image processing
- Memory usage validation
- Processing time measurement

## Benefits of Simplified CI

1. **Faster Execution**: No virtual display setup or GUI testing overhead
2. **Higher Reliability**: Eliminates GUI-related CI failures
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Fewer dependencies and configuration complexity
4. **Focus on Core Functionality**: Concentrates on the primary CLI use case
5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Tests work consistently across environments

## GUI Testing Approach

While GUI tests are removed from CI, they can still be run locally:

```bash
# Run GUI tests locally (requires display)
mvn test -Dtest=JpegScalerGUITest

# Run all tests including GUI
mvn test
```

## Artifacts Generated

The CI pipeline continues to generate and upload:
- Test input images
- Scaled output images (multiple formats and sizes)
- Executable JAR files
- Test results and reports

This configuration provides robust testing of the core JPEG scaling functionality while avoiding the complexity and reliability issues associated with GUI testing in CI environments.
